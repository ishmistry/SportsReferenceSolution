Solution for Cover Letter Question of Sport Reference Engineering Internship Application

My solution for the problem of building a table with team statistics used Linked Lists of objects I created called "Team" which contains a team name and opponent list, and "Opponent" which contains an opponent name and number of wins a team has against that given opponent. After parsing through the JSON file and gathering the necessary information, I use a bubble sort method to organize the teams in lexicographic order. Finally, the teams are printed on the console in a table format with the teams listed as rows and the opponents listed as columns, with each team's wins against a given opponent listed at the intersection of the given team row and opponent column.
